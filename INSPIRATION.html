        <p>
            According to me, inspiration is the process of motivating a person to do something.
             It is a feeling of excitement you get from someone, 
             that stimulates you to do many creative things. The person who inspired me was a gentle and 
             kind hearted Indian Scientist Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. 
             Dr Kalam was loved by millions of people. His life story and achievements have attracted a great 
            deal of interest in the minds of people.
             He wrote a number of books, including an autobiography Wings of Fire, which everyone loves to read.
            Kalam had a dream which needs to come true by our efforts.</p>
        <P>    
            Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam inspired me in a lot of ways but one thing which inspired me 
            most was his reaction and adaptation to Failure.
             He never stopped working and dreaming just because of failure instead he worked harder.
             He was the one who motivated everybody in the country with his inspiring speeches. 
             He taught the youth to take responsibility and work in the direction of development 
             with loyalty and integrity. Kalam was a real treasure of India and a person with no haters. 
             I was inspired by him because he proved that with determination and hard work anything can be achieved. 
             He is one of the great persons in India who has plenty of admirers. 
             He was a man of dreams and creative ideas. He dreamt of making India one of the super-nations in the world.
              His way of dreaming was really different. 
            He told that, “The dreams are not those which you see when you sleep but are those which never 
            let you sleep.” Undoubtedly, these are golden words of wisdom. He was a great inspiration to me 
            as he encouraged everyone to work hard and not think about the result. 
             He believed that, if you work hard, you will definitely get a good result.The Indian people have a huge love towards Kalam. So, he was known as the People’s President. The whole nation reacted to his death with sorrow. He was a great asset to India. His contributions in the field of space science and technology took India to great heights.
            </P>
            <p>Leaders keep on coming and going. His name will certainly go down in history as one of the greatest scientists that India has ever seen. He was a precious gem for each and every Indian and a great inspiration to all students, including me. 

                But, the biggest grief is that we no longer have this great person among us. While giving a speech at the Institute of Management, Shillong he got cardiac arrest. Even after great efforts he left us, making 27 July, 2015 one of the miserable days in the history of India.
            </p>
            <p>At last I would like to say that even though he left us, he is still living in our hearts as an inspiration and a great role model. His valuable words and miraculous deeds will always be remembered. He was a man of great value who taught us the way to make India well developed and we shall always be thankful to him.
